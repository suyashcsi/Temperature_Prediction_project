# Temperature_Prediction_project
This number tells the Visualizer how many future data points need to be predicted. By default, 
the Visualizer spaces the points with the data collection time in the hardware configuration of the product. 
So if you set the product to collect data every 5 minutes, and select 6 prediction points, 
the Visualizer will predict the trend and show 6 points up to 30 minutes into the future.
